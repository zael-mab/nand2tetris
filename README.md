## NAND2Tetris Project
 This repository contains my implementation of the NAND2Tetris course projects.
 
 NAND2Tetris or The Elements of Computing Systems, is a twelve-part course in fundamental computer engineering that I work through the creation of a
 computer from the ground up, starting with the most basic logic gates and building up to a fully functioning computer system.
 Is available as a book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book).



### Projects

The course consists of several projects, each building on the previous one. The projects are as follows:

#### Part 1
1. Boolean Logic - Implement basic logic gates using NAND gates.
2. Boolean Arithmetic - Implement basic arithmetic logic circuits.
3. Sequential Logic - Implement flip-flops, latches, and registers.
4. Machine Language - Implement a machine language and an assembler.
5. Computer Architecture - Implement a CPU and a computer architecture.
6. Operating System - Implement a basic operating system and an Assmbler.
#### part 2
7. VM1 - Stack Arithmetic.
8. VM2 -  Program control.


### Tools Used
To complete the projects, I used the following tools:

- [Hardware Simulator](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) - A graphical tool for testing and debugging the hardware implementation.
- [CPU Emulator](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) - A tool for testing the CPU implementation.
- [Hack Assembler](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) - An assembler for the Hack machine language.
- [Jack Compiler](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) - A compiler for the Jack programming language.

### Acknowledgements

This project is based on the NAND2Tetris course architected by **Noam Nisan** and **Shimon Schocken**. I would like to thank them for creating such an engaging and educational course.
