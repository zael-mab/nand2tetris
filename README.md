# Nand_2_tetris or The Elements of Computing Systems, is a twelve-part course in fundamental computer engineering that i work through the creation of a computer from the ground up, starting with NAND logic gates and ending with an operating system.
# The course, architected by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, is available as a book -The Elements of Computing Systems- visit nand2tetris.org.

# Nand2Tetris consists of twelve chapters:
# _First part =>
